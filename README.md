This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Info

The project is created with React and Javascript in Next13 Framework because I wanted to deploy it in Vercel.

https://eclipse-lg-cards.vercel.app/

For styling I used Tailwind and CSS.
I could't download the images from Figma so I took one from google and icons are from FontAwsome.

In figma the width of the desktop card was 1542px,
I wasen't sure if that was supposed to be the size but I ajusted a little because it was to big.

For Media I used Mobile max-width 768px and Tablet max-width 1024px.
While checking responsive I used from chrome devices for Desktop : Mac, Tablet: Ipad Air and Mobile: Iphone 12

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
